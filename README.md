UBC QUERY PROJECT FOR UBC CPSC 310

This project was created for the UBC CPSC 310 course. It is a third year CPSC course that is mainly focused on the project. 

The query allows an user to search for info in regards to UBC courses and rooms. The database contains courses and rooms. The courses and rooms information are compressed zip files that we unzipped and loaded into memory, as well as disc.

The project is a web app that allows the users to input their query. The query is then retrieved and a request is made through an API that we created. The back-end completes the request by querying and returns the correct result. The back-end implements the many functionalities that a regular query provides such as search, group by, order by, and more.

The project was created by Al, Raghav, and myself (Bill).
