UBC QUERY PROJECT FOR UBC CPSC 310

This project was created for the UBC CPSC 310 course. It is a third year CPSC course that is mainly focused on the project. 

The query allows an user to search for info in regards to UBC courses and rooms, as well as any datasets that the user adds. When the server starts, the database contains courses and rooms, which are zip files provided by the course instructors. A user can then add or delete datasets such as courses through the web app. 

The project is a web app that allows the users to input their query, as well as add/remove datasets. When the user inputs their query and press the search button, the query is retrieved and a request is made through an API that we created using restify. The back-end completes the request by querying and returns the correct result. The back-end implements the many functionalities that a regular query provides such as search, group by, order by, and more. 

The project was created by Al, Raghav, and myself (Bill).
